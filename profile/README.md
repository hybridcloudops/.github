# HybridCloudOps Models for Business Application Development

The adoption of cloud and DevOps models is a current trend in the industry. As part of the digital transformation, many large enterprises start working with hybrid cloud environments. At the same time, business continuity has to be ensured. With the increased use of hybrid cloud, new challenges arise and with this trend the demand for hybrid cloud management solutions. This bachelor thesis introduces a cross-cloud management solution based on Kubernetes that operates with tags and policies to drive deployments to configured cloud. Furthermore, it provides a way to integrate the existing software stack using the same declarative approach. The results show that there is potential for an application in the industry, however, further work is required to build a more comprehensive solution that fulfills the acceptance criteria of a regulated enterprise environment.
